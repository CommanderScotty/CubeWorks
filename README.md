## Git Tutorial
For those on the team who would like a bit of extra help with git, here are the basics of interacting with git and GitHub over the command line.

### Pulling from GitHub
It's a good idea to do this every time you sit down to work on the code in the repository, as it helps avoid merge conflicts.  
1. From the root directory of the git repository: `git pull origin master`

### How to push to GitHub
Do this frequently, at least always when you are done with every programming session. 
1. From the root directory of the git repository: `git add .`
2. Type: `git commit -m "<your comment here>"`
3. Type: `git push origin master`
